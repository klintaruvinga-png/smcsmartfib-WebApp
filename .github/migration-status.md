# SMC SuperFIB → MT5 Migration Status Board

**Last Updated**: 2026-05-27  
**Current Phase**: 4 (Fib Engine Migration — IN-PROGRESS; code complete 2026-05-25; live soak active from 2026-05-27 T0 baseline capture; parity corpus still accumulating)  
**Overall Progress**: 88% (Phases 0–4 code complete; Phases 5/5B/6 code complete pre-emptively; Phases 7–9 scaffolded; only Phase 4 live gate validation + operator activation remain before Phase 5 deployment)  
**Status**: Phase 0 COMPLETE — Phase 1 COMPLETE (2026-05-20) — Phase 2 COMPLETE (2026-05-22) — Phase 3 COMPLETE (2026-05-25; T0 admin baseline captured 2026-05-27, conditional closeout cleared) — Phase 4 IN-PROGRESS (code complete; live soak started; live parity corpus pending) — Phases 5/5B/6 CODE COMPLETE (pre-emptive; gated on Phase 4) — Phases 7–9 SCAFFOLDED (gated)

> Snapshot: Phase 0 gate passed 2026-05-15. Post-fix validation soak at 16:37 UTC confirmed NAS100 (29,263.70) and US30 (49,756.00) both LIVE during active US equity session; XAUUSD (4,556.34) LIVE with candle-history gate cleared. Backend soak: 259,464 engine runs / 0 errors / 69,262 candles over 24h. Frontend feed-status chip lag (BUG-001 staleTime:0) resolved. Watchlist persistence 100% parity. AUDUSD/ETHUSD chop-gate classified as correct live behavior — not a blocker. Full closeout evidence: `.github/migration/phase-updates/phase0-soak-closeout-final-2026-05-15.md`.

## Phase 5B: Fundamentals Regime Feed

**Objective**: Integrate macro-economic data as a numerical bias overlay that filters and weights technical regime and signal conditions  
**Owner**: Track B (data ingestion + normalization) + Track A (MT5 conviction propagation) + Track C (dashboard display)  
**Status**: CODE COMPLETE (2026-05-25) — backend only; gated on Phase 5  
**Prerequisites**: Phase 5 complete  
**Completion Target**: 2026-10-01  
**Readiness Package**: [PHASE5B_IMPLEMENTATION.md](../PHASE5B_IMPLEMENTATION.md)  
**Update**: [phase5b-code-complete-2026-05-25.md](./phase-updates/phase5b-code-complete-2026-05-25.md)

### Design Principle

Fundamentals do not replace fib/regime/signal logic — they filter and weight it:
- **Technicals** = precision entries/exits
- **Fundamentals** = directional conviction multiplier

A fundamental bias score is computed per currency from economic events, normalized into a numeric value, and injected as a macro overlay into the regime engine. The signal engine then applies a conviction weight based on alignment between the technical setup and the fundamental bias.

### Deliverables

- [x] **Data Ingestion Layer** (Track B) *(2026-05-25)*
  - Economic calendar feed (Twelve Data economic events API — `GET /economic_calendar`) ✅
  - Central bank policy state parser: rate decision → hawkish (+1) / hold (0) / dovish (−1) ✅
  - Backend storage: `smc_sf_fundamental_events` + `smc_sf_fundamental_bias` ✅
  - Cron-based pull every 30 min (`twicehourly` WP-Cron) + on-demand `POST /fundamentals/refresh` ✅

- [x] **Normalization Engine** (Track B) *(2026-05-25)*
  - CPI surprise score: `(actual − forecast) / forecast` → mapped to −2/−1/0/+1/+2 ✅
  - Rate decision bias: +1 hike, 0 hold, −1 cut ✅
  - Composite per-currency bias with time decay (30d=1.0×, 30–90d=0.25×, 90d+=excluded) ✅
  - Bias categories: BULLISH / NEUTRAL / BEARISH ✅

- [ ] **Regime Integration** (Track A + Track B)
  - `FundamentalBiasEngine` module reads composite bias score at regime evaluation time
  - Fundamental bias score appended to regime state payload as `fundamental_bias: { base, quote, composite, category }`
  - Backend `ensure_engine_snapshot()` reads and includes fundamental bias at snapshot generation time
  - MT5 EA: `FreshnessEngine` can optionally receive bias score from backend via heartbeat response (read-only; does not affect MT5 data emission)

- [ ] **Signal Conviction Weighting** (Track B)
  - Signal generation reads fundamental bias alignment before computing conviction
  - Conviction multiplier: aligned (1.0×) / neutral (0.7×) / opposed (0.3× — requires stronger technical threshold to qualify)
  - Opposed signals not suppressed outright — flagged with reduced conviction so operator can decide
  - `conviction_weight` field added to signal output payload

- [ ] **Dashboard Visualization** (Track C)
  - Fundamentals bias chip per currency on watchlist row (BULLISH / NEUTRAL / BEARISH)
  - Per-pair bias breakdown panel (base vs. quote currency bias)
  - Upcoming economic events widget (next 24h, filtered by watched pairs)
  - Conviction weight indicator on signal cards
  - Manual bias override toggle (operator can pin a pair to NEUTRAL in edge cases, e.g., pre-NFP blackout)

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Economic calendar events ingested and scored within 15 min of release
- [ ] Composite bias score per currency accurate on known historical test events (NFP, CPI, rate decisions ≥ 2025)
- [ ] Signal conviction weighting applied and visible in dashboard without breaking existing Phase 5 regime parity
- [ ] Existing fib/regime/signal parity thresholds unchanged after Phase 5B overlay
- [ ] Manual bias override does not affect engine snapshot authority or MT5 data emission

### Test Checklist

- [ ] CPI surprise normalization — positive/negative/zero surprise score correctly derived
- [ ] Rate decision parser — hike / cut / hold correctly classified for Fed, ECB, SARB
- [ ] Composite bias decay — 7-day-old event vs. same-day event carry different weights
- [ ] Signal conviction weighting — aligned vs. opposed vs. neutral setups each receive correct multiplier
- [ ] Regime parity regression — Phase 5 parity suites pass unchanged after 5B overlay is live
- [ ] Dashboard conviction chip — renders correctly on all watchlist symbols including pairs with no recent events (defaults to NEUTRAL)

### Data Sources

All sources below are **free tier** — no paid subscriptions required for Phase 5B implementation.

| Feed | Data Covered | Cost | Key Required | Status |
|------|-------------|------|--------------|--------|
| **Twelve Data `/economic_calendar`** | CPI, NFP, GDP, interest rate decisions, all G10 currencies | Free (800 credits/day) | Existing TD key already in backend | ✅ Ready — same key as `/time_series` + `/quote` already in use |
| **MT5 EA feed — `DXYUSD`** | US Dollar Index (DXY) for USD conviction | Free | None — already streaming | ✅ Ready — EA symbol already tracked |
| **MT5 EA feed — `Volatility 75(1s) Index`** | VIX proxy for risk-on/risk-off regime filter | Free | None — already streaming | ✅ Ready — EA symbol already tracked |
| **MT5 EA feed — `GOLD`** | Commodity driver / safe-haven sentiment | Free | None — already streaming | ✅ Ready — EA symbol already tracked |
| **MT5 EA feed — equity indices** | `US SP 500`, `US Tech 100`, `Wall Street 30`, `Germany 40` — risk appetite proxy | Free | None — already streaming | ✅ Ready — EA symbols already tracked |
| **FRED API** (Federal Reserve Economic Data) | US CPI series, Fed Funds Rate history, 10Y Treasury Yield, VIX daily close (`VIXCLS`) — deeper US macro | Free (no rate limits for standard use) | Free API key at fred.stlouisfed.org — new registration required | ⏳ Pending — register key when Phase 5B starts |

**Sources evaluated and ruled out for now (paid or too limited):**
- Trading Economics — free tier severely limited; revisit if FRED + TD coverage is insufficient
- Alpha Vantage — 25 req/day free tier; insufficient for real-time event scoring
- Refinitiv / Bloomberg — paid only

**Coverage gap acknowledged:** ECB, SARB, BoE, RBA central bank *statement text* parsing (for hawkish/dovish NLP scoring beyond rate decision events) is not covered by free feeds. For Phase 5B initial implementation, the Twelve Data economic calendar `interest_rate` event type covers the rate decision outcome (+1/0/−1 bias) for all G10 central banks without requiring statement text parsing. NLP statement parsing is a Phase 5B v2 enhancement.

### Parity Status
```
Fundamental bias accuracy vs. known events: [PENDING]
Signal conviction weighting regression: [PENDING]
Regime engine parity post-overlay: [PENDING]
```

### Blockers
- *Phase 5 (Regime Engine) not complete*

1. ✋ **Never migrate multiple engines simultaneously** — phases are sequential gates
2. ✋ **Every migration phase must achieve parity before next phase** — slip parity = prevent advancement
3. ✋ **Never remove Pine authority until MT5 parity proven** — dual-run validation is mandatory
4. ✋ **Execution only comes after analytical parity** — no trades before Phase 6 validation
